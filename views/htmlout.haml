- if @validator.valid?
  %p
    %span.success It's valid! It's really valid!
    I couldn't find any errors in the PBCore document you provided. Hooray!
- else
  %h2
    %span.failure NO.
    The following potential errors were found in your PBCore document:
  %ul#errors
    - @validator.errors.each do |error|
      %li&= error.to_s
  - if !@validator.valid_xml?
    %p
      Note that these errors indicate that your input could not even be parsed as XML. Please fix those errors in order to allow the PBCore-specific checks to be run.

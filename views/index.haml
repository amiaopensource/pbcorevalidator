The PBCore (Public Broadcasting Metadata Dictionary) was created by the public broadcasting community in the United States of America for use by public broadcasters and others. Initial development funding for PBCore was provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  The PBCore is built on the foundation of the Dublin Core (ISO 15836), an international standard for resource discovery (<a href="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org</a>), and has been reviewed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Usage Board.
